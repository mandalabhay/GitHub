                            	It is almost laughable that this could even be a debate in June of 2013, when certainly the commercial photography world as well as the consumer photography world both made the switch a long time ago.
<br>
<br>

Who's left that stil wants to shoot film? Well to my surprise, everyone in my office: Julius, Ivan, and the "new guy," Mo, all still shoot and covet film. I get it, I do. I had a BW darkroom in high school, and nothing was more of a thrill than pulling that film out of the tank, freshly developed, water and chemicals everywhere just to see that image on film. What a rush. But here's the thing: somehow, you have to get that image into digital form. Unless you are a true purist and are printing your film in an enlarger, old school style. But most people need to get their photography into their computer at some point, in which case, you have to scan.
<br>
<br>

This has been a problem with film for a long time now. One that made me take up the art and science of drum scanning a long time ago (mid-90's); an art I honed for many years (15?) before recently deciding I hated scanning film. It really is a pain, and very few people still shooting film were willing to pay the rates necessary to justify the labor-intensive process of drum scanning. I have since retired my drum scanner. It may see another day, but for now I rarely offer this as a service. But that's a side note...<br>

                            	Being a fine art photgoraphic printer/service bureau (old school term!) were are often asked, "Should I upload 8 bit or 16 bit?"
<br>
<br>

Short answer? It doesn't matter.
<br>
<br>

"It doesn't matter? How can you say that?! Clearly you don't know what you're talking about! Your printing must also be awful!" This was my fear. In fact, my opinion on this topic is why I didn't post a blog sooner, because I know there are so many "experts" out there saying the opposite and, well, bigger is ALWAYS better, right? Well, no, not always (insert Big Gulp joke). You CAN have too much of a good thing in life. In fact, in my opinion, much of life is about learning what to cut out. My decision to finally confront this question was inspired by this old 37signals blog focused on web development, but I feel it's applicable to this discussion:

In our current "pro-sumer" driven photo-technology market, everyone wants your money. Marketers of all sorts of photography software (and yes cameras) have to convince you that you NEED their products to make better images. What makes this really difficult for someone starting out trying to learn digital imaging (aka digital photography) is that the blogs they will find on the subject are often written by people trying to sell a photo product through internet "affiliate marketing." For blogs whose biz model is Ad based, this is less true, but ultimately theses sites have to release fresh content on the latest gear, which goes back to getting you to think you need something new to make good images.<br>
